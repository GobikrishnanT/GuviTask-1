Difference between Copy by value and copy by reference :
	Copy by Value :
		let a = 10;
		let b = a;
		a = 30;
		console.log(b): /// Output : 10 (Here the value only only copied to b from a not an address)
	Copy by Reference :
		Let myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
		let myArray2 = myArray;
		myArray[0] = 10;
		console.log(myArray) ; // [10 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5]
		console.log(myArray) ; // [10 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5]
		
		>> Here the both array pointing the same address so if one array get any update means it will reflect on other also...
